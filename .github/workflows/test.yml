# This action does not set a commit/pull reques status automatically, because it
# is not triggered by the `push` event. Instead it uses the `octokit/request-action`
# action to set a commit status manually.

# When Vercel starts a deployment, it creates a deployment event with state=pending.
# The first job "vercel-deployment-pending" creates a pending status in this case
#
# When Vercel deployment completed successfully, the tests are run against the
# deployments URL. Once completed, a commit status is created based on outcome of tests.
